# Rosalind Solutions

This repo contains my solutions to bioinformatics programming problems from [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/).

Project Rosalind is a bioinformatics learning platform with problems that encourage algorithmic thinking, covering topics topics such as:  

-  Dynamic programming

-  DNA/RNA string manipulation

-  Translation, protein sequence analysis

-  GC content, motif finding

-  Combinatorics, probability in genetics

## To Do

-  Re-implement solutions using Python `argparse` module, making programs usable on the command line

-  Develop testing suites for problems

-  Continue through "Algorithmic Heights" section, focused on general computer algorithms

## Repository Structure

-  Problems are all solved using Python

-  Code is organized by problem ID. Scripts include a docstring explaining their purpose

## Status

I update this repository periodically.
